        - [x] "chrome://"
            - internal pages of the Chrome browser

            - extensions gallery cannot be scripted

### Limitations
- internal pages of the Chrome browser (like chrome://settings/, chrome://extensions/, etc.) which is not allowed due to security reasons.
- The extensions gallery cannot be scripted.

### Other Concerns
- [X] decide if all tabs or current tab only?
    - current tab only
         - the outlining would not be active until they click the button in that tab.
- [x] when turned ON and tab is loaded
    - decided to apply outline to current tab only
- [x] What if the page reloads while turned ON
    - toggle style, no need to rely on button truth or false
- [x] each tab, diff settings/outline style
    - Store tabId
- [x] what if turned on then close browser then open again
    - resets stored session data
    - to prevent storing unnecessary file
- [x] remove stored data for non-existing tabID
    - remove style on Close - tabs.onRemoved, window.onRemoved?
        - but what if the browser closed differently? 
            - such as crashes
    - clear storage when opened?
    - get style for corres ID?
    - just save using session

### Initial
- Per tab, save data state
    - initialize
        -  
- Set 2 action: toggle and change
    - Toggle
        - if style doesn't exist, add it
        - if style exist, remove it
    - Change
        - if style exist, change cssText content
        - if no, nothing happens
    - solves the ability to toggle on any style
    - Cons: it will get applied when 

- On new tab focused
    1. retrieve save data
    2. send it to react, set as default
    - popup opens, retrieve file
    - state, save include ID
- Save tab
    3. include tab id in save data
- Browser load/open
    - check if tab exist
    - if not, remove
    - if yes stay
- Per browser loads, get all tabs ID then get the saved data
    - check if id of each in the saved data is present to the tabs
        - if not, remove that part in the saved data
        - if yes, remain
            - save new data
    - what listener to use? - windows.onCreated?
        - what if new window is created when original is still opened?
        - it will clear the tabs
    - expiration of data?
    - add a button to clear local storage
- Per tab have saved data {outline attributes, button state}
    - save data, including there id as key
        - tabID: {outline, state}
    - every time the tab is opened/hotkey is pressed
        - get current tab id
        - get load data
            - check if current tab's ID is present
                - if yes, send data to popup (with tabID)???
                - if no, send default value to popup
- Input/Button
    - per change/event send message to background
        - Save - save changes to data
        - Apply - apply changes to css
